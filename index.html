		<h2>My Childhood:</h2>
		<p>When I was younger, I was part of the ski club of my resort. This allowed me to ski every weekend and train for competitions.</p>

		<h2>The competition:</h2>
		<p>First of all, I participated in competitions organized by my station which was disputed between my comrades and me in 2014, and was also able to participate in the French junior championship: Le coq d'or.</p>

		<h2>Being a teacher:</h2>
		<p>Today I have stopped competing and I devote myself fully to my seasonal job as a ski instructor. This allows me to share the passion for skiing and the mountains. I also learn the basics of learning and to be more patient. Finally, it allows me to pay for part of my studies.</p>
